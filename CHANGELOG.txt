CHANGE LOG
--------------------

2008-04-04 [geoffrey.mcgill]
1.  Fixed Parser.js bug where the parser was using the static month token to match against the 
    abbreviatedMonthNames array in the CultureInfo file. This was causing problems when the
    abbreviatedMonthNames strings were not English.

    Example
    
    // CultureInfo = "de-DE.js"
    Date.parse("mai"); // "May", but returns null
    
    
    The fix required changing the following (approx line #525) in Parser.js.

    // Old
    this.month = ((s.length == 3) ? $D.getMonthNumberFromName(s) : (Number(s) - 1));

    // New
    this.month = (s.length == 3) ? "jan feb mar apr may jun jul aug sep oct nov dec".indexOf(s)/4 : Number(s) - 1;

2008-04-01 [geoffrey.mcgill]
1.  Fixed bug where Date.nov().final().sunday() would return the second to last sunday.
	
	The bug was in the function moveToNthOccurrence (core.js). If the final day of the month
	matched the final day required, then the second-to-last instance of the day required 
	would be returned. 
	
	Example
	
	// Old - Final day of month is a Sunday
	Date.nov().final().sunday() // return 23-Nov-2008
	
	// New
	Date.nov().final().sunday() // return 30-Nov-2008

--------------------

2008-03-27 [geoffrey.mcgill]
1.  Fixed bug which caused the string "Jan 2008" to not be parsed correctly. The 'Day' value would be
	set to "today's" Day. For example, if Today is the 27th day of the month, Date.parse("Jan 2008")
	would return "27-Jan-2008", although "1-Jan-2008" was expected.
	 
	The bug was caused by a check to see if the value of this.month was existed within Parser.finish.
	If a variable is set to the Number "0", JavaScript appears to treat that as null or undefined 
	even though the Number "0" is valid.
	
	Required an explicit check for the Number "0" in addition to the variable existence check.
	
	Example
	
	// Old (line #727 in parser.js)
	if (this.month && !this.day) { 
	
	// New (line #727 in parser.js)
	if ((this.month || this.month === 0) && !this.day) { 
	
2.  Added about 100 new tests to /trunk/test/partial/ which test for vaiations on date strings 
	with no Day value and No Year-or-Month value. View online at http://www.datejs.com/test/partial/

--------------------

2008-03-24 [geoffrey.mcgill]
1.  Fixed bug where a single digit minute or second value would not parse correctly. 
	See forum post http://tinyurl.com/3d8b57.
	
	Made the following revision:

	// Old
	g.hms = _.cache(_.sequence([g.H, g.mm, g.ss], g.timePartDelimiter));
		
	// New
	g.hms = _.cache(_.sequence([g.H, g.m, g.s], g.timePartDelimiter));
	
2.  Added a few tests to /trunk/test/time/ relating to above fix.

--------------------

2008-03-18 [geoffrey.mcgill]
1.  Made small revision to .addDays() which should avoid addition/subtraction issues when 
    spanning over a Daylight Saving Time (Summer Time) change.

--------------------

2008-03-03 [geoffrey.mcgill]
1.  Fixed .toString() bug where .toString would not return four characters if the year was less than 1000.
        
	// Old 
	console.log(Date.today().set({year: 10}).toString("yyyy"); // "10"
	
	// New
	console.log(Date.today().set({year: 10}).toString("yyyy"); // "0010"
	
	The fix also corrected the same issue with .toString("yy") if the year was less than 10.
	
	// Old 
	console.log(Date.today().set({year: 5}).toString("yy"); // "5"
	
	// New
	console.log(Date.today().set({year: 5}).toString("yy"); // "05"

--------------------

2008-02-26 [geoffrey.mcgill]
1.  Dan Yoder fixed bug with timeContext pattern where if a date included "april" or "august", the parser thought the 'a' was the beginning of a time part (as in am/pm).
       
        "added a quick negative lookahead to the regexp to make sure the 'a' isn't followed by a 'u' or a 'p'."
        
	// Old 
	timeContext: /^\s*(\:|a|p)/i
	
	// New
	timeContext: /^\s*(\:|a(?!u|p)|p)/i
	
2.  Fixed bug in Parser.finish, which was causing "11 Aug 2007 7:15:00 am EDT" to fail.

--------------------

2008-02-21 [geoffrey.mcgill]
1.  Fixed bug in .parseExact where if the month was January ('0') the Parser.finishExact function was resetting to the current month.
2.  Added several new tests to /trunk/test/parseExact/.

--------------------

2008-02-18 [geoffrey.mcgill]
1.  Added .toISOString() back to sugarpak.js. Still investigating to figure out why/how this function was removed at Build 130-131.
2.  Fixed small bug in .is().weekday() where .weekday() was not returning 'this' if the .is() flag had not been set.

--------------------

2008-02-07 [geoffrey.mcgill]
1.  Fixed bug in parser.js which prevented some strings from parsing when the 'day' of the date string was greater than the last day of the current month.

	Example
	
	// Today is 13-Feb-2008
	Date.parse("30 Apr 2008"); //FAIL
	
	Date strings which fall under this scenario should now parse correctly.

--------------------

2008-02-05 [geoffrey.mcgill]
1.  Added .is().weekday() function to sugarpak.js. 
    The .weekday() function determines if the current date is a weekday. 
    The function must be preceded by the .is() function.
    
    Example

    Date.today().is().weekday(); // true|false    

--------------------

2008-02-04 [geoffrey.mcgill]
1.  Added .getOrdinal() tests to the new sugarpak (/trunk/test/sugarpak/) test package.
    See http://www.datejs.com/test/sugarpak/index.html

--------------------

2008-01-02 [geoffrey.mcgill]
1.  Added .toISOString() to sugarpak.js. Returns ISO 8601 formatted string of date.
2.  Changed .toJSONString() to return string value wrapped in double-quotes ("") as per
    JSON.org spec. 
   
    If you want an ISO/JSON date formatted string WITHOUT the double-quotes, please pass 
    a format to the .toString() function.
   
    Example
   
    new Date().toString("yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ");
   
3.  Fixed bug where Date.parse("monday") was not returning correct year when the current
    week overlapped the end of year.
4.  Fixed bug in .parseExact() where day was being initialized to '1' if no day was present in the date string.
    This was a problem when only parsing a Time.
5.  New tests added to /test/parseExact/.
6.  Found and fixed bug where if a string to be parsed was a digit with a trailing space.

    Example
    
    // Old
    Date.parse("5 "); // returned current day at 5 AM. Wrong.
    
    // New
    Date.parse("5 "); // return 5th day of current month. Correct.
    
    Just trimming whitespace before sending string into parser fixed the problem.

7.  Added parser support for... 
		"3 years ago"
		"7 hours ago"

--------------------

2007-12-27 [geoffrey.mcgill]
1.  Modified the offset values of Date.CultureInfo.timezones.
2.  Added <static> Date.compare(date1, date2).
        
        Example
        
        var date1 = Date.today();
        var date2 = Date.today().add(1).day();
        
        Date.compare(date1, date2); // returns -1

3.  Added <static> Date.equals(date1, date2).        

        Example
        
        var date1 = Date.today();
        var date2 = Date.today().add(1).day();
        
        Date.equals(date1, date2); // returns false

4.  Fixed bug in Date.getDayNumberFromName() where it was not checking against the Date.CultureInfo.shortestDayNames array.
5.  Removed <static> Date.getDayName(dayOfWeek). Please use Date.CultureInfo.dayNames[dayOfWeek]. Other options include:
        Date.CultureInfo.dayNames[dayOfWeek]
        Date.CultureInfo.abbreviatedDayNames[dayOfWeek]
        Date.CultureInfo.shortestDayNames[dayOfWeek]

    If you have a Date instance, please use .toString().
        
        Example
        
        Date.today().toString("dddd"); // "Thursday"
        Date.today().toString("ddd"); // "Thu"
        
5.  Removed <static> Date.getMonthName(month). Please use Date.CultureInfo.monthNames[month]. 
    Other options include:
        Date.CultureInfo.monthNames[month]
        Date.CultureInfo.abbreviatedMonthNames[month]

    If you have a Date instance, please use .toString().
        
        Example
        
        Date.today().toString("MMMM"); // "December"
        Date.today().toString("MMM"); // "Dec"

6.  Added Date.prototype.hasDaylightSavingTime(). 
    Returns a boolean value indicating whether Daylight Saving Time is observed in the current time zone.
7.  Added Date.prototype.isDaylightSavingTime(). 
    Returns a boolean value indicating whether this Date instance is within the Daylight Saving Time range for the current time zone.
8.  Verified core.js, sugarpak.js, and time.js are passing JSLint (http://www.jslint/) in "Strict whitespace" mode.
